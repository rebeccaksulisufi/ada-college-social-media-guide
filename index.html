          <h3>How can organisations use YouTube to post a range of different content?
          </h3>
          <p>
            As YouTube has a range of uses and benefits which for businesses,
            can compliment their other social media channels.
            They can post content from just pure promotions on their channel,
            to advertisements, to tutorials, and even just fact videos.
            All of which can be used by businesses to promote their brand.
          </p>

          <h3><br><br>How can organisations use YouTube to provide direct and indirect advertising?</h3>
          <h4>Direct Advertising</h4>
          <p>
            Youtube has a lot of direct advertising on its website,
            it has many promoted and paid adverts along the sidebars
            next to ‘recommended videos’ and also before videos on YouTube,
            there is a short advert which you are required to watch for 5 seconds,
            so even if you're not interested in what the ad contains,
            you have to watch it for a minimum of 5 seconds,
            so you are at least now aware of that business in the ad.</p>
          <h4>Indirect Advertising </h4>
          <p>
            Businesses also pay certain figures on YouTube to promote
            their products discreetly in their videos. So if someone were
            doing a makeup tutorial, a make-up business may pay them,
            to mention their products in their makeup video. Same applies
            for something like videos games, a company may send games to figures
            on YouTube for free, so people become more aware of their brand.
          </p>

          <h3><br><br>How can organisations use YouTube to provide special offers?</h3>
          <p><a href="#"><img width="550" height="550" class="pull-left" alt="sample-image" src="images/grammarly.png"></a>
            Youtube can be used to provide special offers in their adverts.
              Before videos, adverts are played, where brands have around a
              minute to promote their brand. However, some brands use this
              opportunity to tell customers about any promotions that they
              currently have. personally, I may have seen over 50 Grammarly
              adverts on YouTube, with just a general overview of their service,
               or a promotion, like student discounts, or just overall discounts.
             </p>

          <h3><br><br>How can organisations use YouTube to provide customer service?
          </h3>
          <p>
            When having to answer complicated questions on a product that a
            business is selling, especially if it is a hands-on product,
            it may be simpler to explain it in a video demonstration/tutorial
            rather than replying to each customer individually in an email/tweet
            where they can't really physically see how to use the product.
            If a business helps their customers with tutorials and so on,
            providing more customer service, customers won't have to go out of
            their way to find answers but instead, know that the business is
             well prepared to deal with any questions that customers have.
          </p>

        <div class="col-six tab-full">

          <h3>How can organisations use YouTube to provide information?</h3>
          <p><a href="#"><img width="550" height="550" class="pull-left" alt="sample-image" src="images/youtube.png"></a>
            For example, for a business which is mainly focused on a physical product,
            they could use YouTube to show their products being used! This is
            extremely important for all types of businesses but specifically
            those who are online-based only and have no other way of
            demonstrating their product. Youtube can also be used for
            demonstrating expertise. By providing videos giving expertise,
             customers are more likely to move towards your brand and your
             product. PlayStation is typically famous for this, they upload
             videos on YouTube featuring montages from their games, but
              specifically have their logo in the corner of the screen at
              all times, so users know where this video came from, and who
               the games/services are provided by.
          </p>

          <h3><br><br>How can organisations use YouTube to provide humorous content?</h3>

          <p><a href="#"><img width="550" height="550" class="pull-left" alt="sample-image" src="images/otterbox.png"></a>
            By businesses providing humorous content, people are more likely
            to remember that ad and will spread by the word-of-mouth.
            One business, OtterBox, provides funny ads. In one of their ads,
            they had a bear dressed in a waistcoat spraying a fire
            extinguisher over a man holding his phone. The point of the advert
            was to show that their phone cases can survive anything.
            The point is the video was so wacky that it stays in the customer's
            mind, and they'll spread the news about this funny video they saw,
            and they might even buy the product to test if it really can
            ‘survive anything’.
          </p>

          <h3><br><br>Audience profiles</h3>
          <p>
            According to Omnicore, 62% of Youtube users are male. With men
           typically watching strategy videos, or football, and women
           apparently watching beauty videos.
           In regards to age, 35+ are the fastest growing YouTube demographics.
           ¾ older users use YouTube for nostalgia and not just tutorials or news.
           Millennials prefer YouTube over traditional television and 60% of all
           people prefer YouTube to live television. In 2018, 78% of
           YouTube users had an annual household income of under £14k
           showing that people from lower-income backgrounds are more
           likely to use YouTube.

              How can organisations use Twitter to post a range of different content?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Twitter has a range of ways to post content,
              ranging from posting a video on the app, posting images,
              even short tweets, or paying to promote their tweets or hashtags
              on Twitter to gain more publicity.
            </p>

            <h3>
              <br><br>How can organisations use Twitter to provide direct and indirect advertising?
            </h3>

            <h4>Direct Advertising</h4>
            <p>
              On Twitter, there is a lot of direct advertising,
              businesses can pay for their tweets to reach a wider
              number of viewers. Twitter advertisements work like bidding.
              The company will prepare the message they want to send and the
              result they expect from this, for example, if they want a bigger
              follow count on Twitter or more traffic sent to their website.
              Then the company will set a price for each interaction,
              (new follow/click to the website) and then ads will be
              launched based on that
            </p>

            <h4>Indirect Advertising </h4>
            <p>
              Businesses can also pay high profile figures to promote their
              products in the same way YouTube does. The business will pay a
              user to indirectly promote their product in one of their tweets,
              and the followers of that person may be influenced by the tweet
              and may go on to buy the product, or at least check it out.
            </p>


            <h3><br><br>How can organisations use Twitter to provide special offers?</h3>
            <p><a href="#"><img width="550" height="550" class="pull-left" alt="sample-image" src="images/twitteroffer.png">
              </a><p> Businesses on Twitter can post tweets with details
                on certain offers they are having, or even post a link to a
                webpage containing more detail. They can then pay to promote
                this tweet, allowing more people to see the tweet and become
                more aware of the rand. Tweets that have been promoted will
                display that it is a promoted tweet as underneath it, it will
                say ‘Promoted by x’.
            </p>

            <h3><br><br>How can organisations use Twitter to provide customer service?
            </h3>
            <p><a href="#"><img width="550" height="550" class="pull-left" alt="sample-image" src="images/voxi.png">
              </a><p> Voxi deals with customers in a calm way,
                no matter what the complaint, or the language used by
                the customer, they will reply in a clear, calm and concise way.
                In this example, VOXI ends the age discrimination accusations by
                explaining why their phone plan is only for under 30s.
                VOXI is aimed specifically for under 30s, due to the fact
                that some may not be financially stable at that stage to pay
                a massive phone bill. VOXI is a partner with Vodafone and
                there are similar plans available for over 30s on Vodafone.

              Twitter pages can be used by companies to provide customers with information.
              For example, this tweet by Monzo, informs users on how Monzo actually can
              help you plan ahead, and how to actually use certain features in the app
              that some people may be unfamiliar using.

              Businesses can use numerous methods to provide humorous
              content throughout their social media accounts. On twitter,
              companies usually depreciate and argue with other companies
              to make them stand out, even if the product is not actually
              better, if the tweet is funny, people will retweet it based
              solely on that fact, thus leading to the brand being promoted more.
              In this example, burger king promotes their newest deal, and one user,
              knowing the feud between burger king and wendy’s, provoked the
              situation by asking what wendy’s thinks of burger king's new offer,
              which wendy’s responded back in saying that the food is inedible.

            <h3><br><br>Audience profiles</h3>
            <p>
              Twitter has a slight distinction between the ages that use the platform
              with 37% of active Twitter users being between the age of 18 and 29,
              and 25% of users being 30-49 years old, showing that older users tend
              not to use twitter. Out of all internet users, 24% of all internet
              male users use Twitter whereas 21% of all internet female users use
              Twitter, so in regards to, age it is almost evenly distributed and
              there is no bias in gender for this platform. 53% of people who
              have an annual income of $60k-$70k use twitter comparing to the
              53% that have an annual income over $100k. The statistic shows
              that those who have a higher annual income are more likely to
              use twitter (Anon n.d)

                They can create a business profile on Instagram, they can advertise on Instagram,
                or even just have a presence on Instagram. All of these ways of posting

              <p>
                Instagram has a lot of direct advertising.
                After every couple of posts, you scroll through, there will be
                an advert for a product/service. With 75% of users actually
                clicking onto an ad after viewing it , advertising on instagram
                has proven to be highly rewarding for businesses (Buckle, 2015)
              </p>
              <br>
              <h4>Indirect Advertising </h4>
              <p>
                Instagram is notorious for having high-profile influencers being
                paid by certain brands to advertise their product. The influencer
                will post an image of the product/service and sometimes may even
                have a discount code with that influencers name, to get a discount
                if they buy the product, making people want to buy the product even more.

                which may make users check out the product. When users see ‘limited edition’
                they may think that the product is actually better than it is and may
                buy it based solely on the fact that there is a sale.

              </h3>
              <p>By having an Instagram account, businesses can directly
                see what their customers think about their product, so they
                know where to improve. On Instagram, users can comment, like,
                and share their favourite posts. By having the user-business
                relationship on a public platform, you are essentially getting
                direct feedback from the users on what they like and dislike
                about your product.

                According to Omnicore , Instagram has 1 billion monthly
                Instagram users with 500 million being daily active Instagram users.
                Instagram has more females on their app than males with 68% of
                Instagram users being female.
                Demographics show than 72% of teens use Instagram but only 15%
                say they use it the most out of all social media. Although a
                large number of teens use social media, six out of 10 adults
                have Instagram accounts, so Instagram is balanced out in terms
                of age as there is a wide variety of ages for people having
                Instagram accounts.
                60% of  users who had an income over $100k a year used
                twitter comparing to only 36% of twitter users who earned
                $60k-$70k, showing that those who had a higher annual
                income were more likely to use twitter (Mughal, 2019)

              <p>
                With Instagram, businesses can post different types of
                media on their page. They could post tutorials on how
                to use their product or service which allows customers
                to be able to have that peace of mind that if they are
                having a problem, they can go straight to the Instagram
                page and there could be a person that has had a similar
                problem, and instagram has responded to it by creating a
                help tutorial for other people having the same issue.
                Instagram doesn't only work as a promoter for a business
                but also like a support manual, or a customer support service.

                      On snapchat, there's a discover page which contains
                      multiple news outlets who post content on snapchat to
                      keep people informed on the news around them as some

                    <h4>Direct Advertising</h4>
                    <p>
                      Snapchat has a lot of advertising, between every couple of
                      snap stories, there will be a an advertisement by some company.
                      However research shows that snapchat may actually not be the
                      best company to advertise on with more than 60% of users
                      skipping ads on the platform with no engagement (Anon, 2017)

                    <p>
                      However in regards to indirect advertising, snapchat works
                      the same way as instagram, high-profile influencers will
                      have an snapchat account with lots of subscribers to it,
                      companies will pay them to post their products on their story,
                      and users may be more inclined to buy it if they know someone
                      they admire is using it as well.

                      discounts to make people want to buy their product.
                      Or, they can even contact influencers on instagram to
                      post their new offers on their snapchat account and will
                      usually get some sort of personalised code. For example if
                      Kim Kardashian were to promote L'oreal's new hair dye,
                      she would promote a special discount code like ‘Kim2019’,
                      and for every customer that buys a product with that
                      discount code, Kim would get commision.

                      They got snaps from customers who have questions/queries
                      about their recent purchases, and the good thing about
                      snapchat is that the users can send live pictures and
                      videos as well (Admin, 2017) .

                      In regards to age, 71% of snapchat users are under 34 years old,
                      showing the massive bias of users in snapchat. It is mainly
                      dominated by the younger generation.  People under the age of
                      25 use snapchat for 40 minutes on average everyday, which is
                      currently more than instagrams demographic (Mughal, 2019).
                      70% of snapchat users are female, and 30% are male,
                      which is an uneven distribution in regards to gender with
                      females being more active on snapchat than males (Mughal, 2019).
                      There is an even distribution of snapchat users based on
                      income with 31% of users having an income between £21k-£28k,
                      29% between £28k-£34k and 32% between £34k-£48k (Anon, n.d).<br>

      <p><a href="#"><img width="350" height="350" class="pull-left" alt="sample-image" src="images/loughborough.png"></a>
        Loughborough university has used snapchat to create campaigns
        using snapchats famous geofilters. Geofilters are a overlay
         that can be used on their snaps, if they are in the target area.
         They created a geofilter which promoted Loughborough open day.
         They hosted this geofilter throughout their open day and graduation
         so that graduate students could share their last moments at university
         with their friends and family on snapchat, which essentially promotes
         the university to other prospective students (Mattis, 2018).

        <br><br>Recommendation for how they should use social media going forward
      </h3>
      <p><a href="#"><img width="550" height="550" class="pull-left" alt="sample-image" src="images/instaad.png">
      </a>The approach that Loughborough is taking now, creating geofilters
      on snapchat is a great start to engage current students at the university
      and even a way to promote the university to other prospective students.
      However, I do believe that they are restricting themselves to a certain age
      group by using geofilters on snapchat, given that snapchat is dominated
      by the younger generation. Loughborough university should consider
      reaching out via a range of platforms as the younger generation
      are not the only people who are looking for universities but instead
      people of all ages go to university so they should use a variety of
      platforms to try and capture all age groups.

    <div class="col-six tab-full">

            <h3>
              Analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of their approach
            </h3>
            <p>
              As said before, 70% of snapchat users are under the age 34,
              meaning that when promoting on snapchat, you are more likely
              to be in contact with the younger generation, so by promoting on
              snapchat, Loughborough university is essentially reaching a younger
              audience which may actually be in the process of looking for a
              university to study at. The snaps on snapchat only last 24 hours,
              and although this may mean that Loughborough had a limited time to
              promote their university, it also means that in these 24 hours,
              they can reach people from all around the world, from different
              time zones, therefore promoting their university in a much wider
              range than just the UK. By using custom geofilters,
              it makes Loughborough’s snaps more interesting as they
              are not just promoting their brand through an ad but are
              ctually personalising their advertising for user to find it
              interactive. However, a main restraint with snapchat is that
              the videos and images don't last long. The images/videos disappear
              forever after a certain time, meaning that your geofilter may be
              used by users but they will only last a limited amount of time,
              and Loughborough is dependant on the user actually using the
              geofilter for it to actually be promoted around. Snapchat also
              doesn't offer a re-share option option like other social
              medias like twitter or facebook, but instead the only way to
              share content is to screenshot it and post it on another social media.
              So again, Loughborough’s  advertising is completely dependant on
              whether people actually use their geofilter. With snapchat,
              there is limited engagement throughout the app as unlike other
              social medias like facebook/twitter there isnt a feed that users
              can scroll through but instead Loughborough’s advertising was
              completely dependent on users actually using their geofilters.

            <h3>
              <br><br>Advice on how they should manage the risks and issues involved
            </h3>
            <p>A problem with advertising on snapchat is that users are able
              to skip ads without having to watch it for a certain period like
              facebook or YouTube. This in turn means that if users don't want
              to see the ad, they can skip it straight away, making the average
              ad view duration extremely low, a lot lower than facebook and YouTube.
              The average ad time on snapchat is 2.5 seconds. To mitigate this,
              businesses only have up to 3 seconds to promote their brand before
              the user skips it, so they should make those first few seconds,
              the most interesting to get the attention of the user so they
              continue to watch the rest of the ad and become more aware on
              your brand. An audience doesn't want advertising, they want
              experience, and that's what Loughborough University should be
              aiming for. Also, since snapchat only has a 24 hour limit on
              how much their snaps last, businesses will have to constantly
              post ads again and again to reach their audience and track the
              results separately.  However this means that businesses are able
              to see at what time their ad had the longest average time, and if
              their ad wasn't successful, they could try a different type of
              approach and be able to see which type of ad worked the best for
              them so they can continue with that approach. Facebook and Instagram
              ads are all personalised based on data that the user shows about themselves.
              However snapchat ads have no data-driven targeting capabilities
              meaning that unless Loughborough specifically sets a target of what
              age they want to target, their adverts will be shown at random. So
              although snapchat has the audience, it lacks analytics, and targeting.
              However, if the University knows what age range it wants to target
              (E.g 18-24 year olds as they are most likely to be going to University at this time),
              then snapchat can target the Universities ads specifically to that age range.

          The university of Cambridge has a YouTube channel to advertise
          their university while still providing educational content.
          This allows for them to show students what life at Cambridge is
          like in regards to student life, and teaching (QS Digital Marketing, 2016).
          They also post
          documentaries which includes research that is being doing at
          Cambridge university.

        <h3>
          <br><br>Recommendation for how they should use social media going forward
        </h3>
        <p>
        </a>I recommend that Cambridge University should continue with the
        youtube videos as even though it may not bring in more prospective
        students by posting these videos, it provides the users who already
        have an interest in Cambridge to see how life there is like, and
        what it's like to study there which can possibly make people who
        are unsure of applying, to be more confident in their choice.
        However, I do also suggest that they widen their social media
        reach by considering using other platforms, like facebook, as
        although having a youtube channel with videos is a good step,
        having a page which has all of the information about your
        University is also beneficial as it can act as a one-stop-shop
        when people want to find out information about the University.

                Analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of their approach
              </h3>
              <p>
                Youtube has measurable analytics which allow Cambridge
                University to see how well their videos are doing and
                whether there are certain videos which are more popular
                among users than users, so they can carry on to provide
                content similar to those lines. Youtube is also free,
                so there is no charge for the university to upload any
                videos so in a sense, it's essentially free advertising!
                There is a huge audience on YouTube, with over 30 million (Mughal 2019)
                daily active users meaning that the audience potential is
                huge, and form YouTube you can share videos from your
                YouTube page onto other social media platforms like
                twitter, facebook, or instagram. With YouTube, it may be
                free to upload videos, but it doesn't promote the videos,
                so Cambridge University would have to promote their videos
                on other platform, or even have to pay youtube to market
                specific tags. If Cambridge University doesn't spread the
                news that their video is out, then no one is going to see it.
                There’s also no guarantee that your video will actually make any
                difference to the business. Cambridge University could spend
                thousands of pounds developing a video to put on youtube, for
                there not to be any difference in terms of prospective students.
                Negative review on a video could also damage a businesses reputation.
                If there are negative comments on their YouTube videos, it can severely
                damage the reputation of Cambridge University, and since google now
                owns youtube, this can also affect Cambridge University's search
                rankings

              <p>
                Since Cambridge university has other social media platforms than
                youtube, they can just promote their youtube videos on their
                other social media platforms, which will definitely rack up
                some views which will diminish the worry that they won't get
                any views on their youtube videos. Although there genuinely
                isnt a guarantee that there will be a difference analytically.
                However, posting videos still allows anyone who *is* interested
                to see into the life of cambridge, and if people shared the
                videos, there may be a wider range of viewers which then
                could eventually come across a range of people. As most of
                the videos on Cambridge’s YouTUbe channel are factual videos,
                there is less likely to be controversy about the videos they post,
                therefore not having to consider negative comments damaging the
                reputation on Cambridge University.

      <h5>Assessment</h5>
      <h1>How can each social media target potential Ada students?</h1>

      <h2><br>Youtube</h2>
        <p>
          Youtube can be used in multiple ways to recruit students.
          Ada can post a guided tour of Ada, or have testimonials
          from staff or students. They could also have videos about
          the content in lessons (similar to what Cambridge University did).
          Ada College could also have Q&A sessions on YouTube so that
          prospective students can ask any questions they have about the
          college in general. They could also host live videos on
          events that happen in Ada, particular on Ada Lovelace day,
          as it’s such a big day for the college.
        </p>

        <h2><br>Twitter</h2>
          <p>
            Twitter is a great platform to use for student recruitment,
            as a wide chunk of of the users on twitters are the younger
            generation, and students. A way Ada College could use
            twitter, is by posting engaging sharable content.
            Tweets that contain images recieve 150% more retweets
            than those with only text (Mawhinney, n.d).
            Twitter ads are also extremely useful, as students
            will see the ad regardless whether they follow the college or not.
          </p>

          <h2><br>Instagram</h2>
            <p>
              When using instagram ads, businesses have around 3-5
              images to advertise themselves. Ada College could use
              those 3-5 photos to tell a story. They could showcase the
              Ada building, the Ada learning, and just a general
              overview of Ada. When Ada College posts content on
              their instagram page, by mixing generic hashtags,
              with hashtags that are specific to Ada can encourage
              their new and existing followers to use them,
              widening the reach of Ada.
            </p>

            <h2><br>LinkedIn</h2>
              <p>
                Posts on LinkedIn which have a lot of content are 4
                times more likely to be skipped (LinkedIn, n.d). To engage potential
                students, Ada College should grab the students attention
                with an image or video. Ada College can also used
                LinkedIn to engage with secondary schools. They can
                connect with schools, to provide information on the
                college and ask to potentially speak at the secondary
                school’s careers fair, which is increasing the
                publicity of Ada. LinkedIn can also be used to
                share authentic stories about the college and about
                what life is like at Ada.
              </p>

              <h2><br>Facebook</h2>
                <p>
                  It's been shown that students will visit a school’s
                  social media page before they join the school,
                  but will not follow or like as they are afraid
                  that the school will see their page which will
                  impact their application. However, once the student
                  has been accepted into the school, they would follow
                  and like the page, as the student feels more comfortable
                  (Recruitment, 2016).
                  So since the student may not like and follow the page,
                  they wont be kept updated with the school.
                  Considering this, the best approach may be to post
                  facebook ads as they are highly effective, and the
                  student doesn't have to be following your page to view the ad.
                  Facebook ads also allows businesses to narrow down their
                  targeting, so Ada College could base their ad on those
                  who are currently in education, or based on their age.
                </p>

                <h2><br>Snapchat</h2>
                  <p>
                    Given that snapchat is dominated by the
                     younger generation, it's a really good
                     choice when trying to reach out to potential
                     Ada students. Ada College could post an ‘inside look’
                     of what life at Ada is like, from lessons, to extra
                     curricular activities. This in turn provides any
                     potential students of a feel of what Ada College is
                     really like. Snapchat could also be used in a quick-fire
                     Q&A. Students could ask questions about how to apply,
                     or if they have any questions about the course, or
                     wish to speak to a current Ada student personally.
                     It can also invite participation with potential students,
                     Ada College could host a competition, and the
                     winning ‘snap’ gets a Ada College hoodie or badge.
                     Ada College could also create their own geofilter,
                     and if the students at Ada used them, it would promote
                     the college to everyone that the students already have
                     on snapchat, or if Ada College chose an even bigger range,
                     people earby could see the geofilter, and may be interested
                     in Ada College, created a wider range of publicity.
                  </p>


                  <h1><br><br><hr>Which approach would be best to reach potential Ada students?</h1>
                  <p>
                    In regards to targeting Ada students, I would recommend Snapchat.
                    A large chunk of young people are on Snapchat, increasing your
                    audience already. Having short snaps about the college would be
                    most enticing to students due to the fact that the snapchat videos
                    are short so it provides a summary of the college so prospective
                    students don't have to scroll through a college’s whole page to
                    find the content that they want.
                    Again, snapchat provides prospective students with the option
                    to ‘snap’ the college back, if they have any questions or queries,
                    providing a direct contact line between the college and the student.
                    Snapchat also provides a range of ways to post: Ada College could
                    post links (to other social media), images, and photos.
                    Lastly, Snapchat allows Ada College to be able to personalise
                    themselves with geofilters. The college could make their own
                    custom geofilter so that everyone in a certain geographical
                    location can access this filter, and find out more about Ada.
                  <br></p>
